Social Media Web Application
</br> Developed and deployed a social media web application ‘MyWorld’ where I implemented all the classic features like login/sign-up, timeline, profile page, create posts, share posts, follow/unfollow users, etc.
</br> Made REST APIs using Node.js on backend and React.js is used on frontend.
</br> Used MongoDB Atlas as database, Firebase for media storage and JWT for user authentication.
